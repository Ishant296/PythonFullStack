        <h1>Welcome to the Stroy</h1>
    </div>
    <p>In the ancient world of Elthoria, where magic thrived and gods walked the earth, there was a being known only as
        Atheon, the Godslayer. Born of mortal blood yet blessed—or cursed—by the power to slay the divine, he roamed the
        lands, feared and revered by all. His crimson blade, forged in the fires of the Abyss, could cut through the
        fabric of reality itself, severing the very essence of gods. For centuries, he hunted down the pantheon of
        Elthoria, toppling them one by one. Some saw him as a liberator, freeing the world from the tyranny of gods,
        while others called him a demon, an enemy to all that was sacred.

        But in his quest, Atheon encountered a legend whispered in the winds—the existence of Valtherion, the Dragon God
        of Creation. Unlike the other gods who ruled over elements or emotions, Valtherion was the architect of the
        world itself, weaving the cosmos together with his breath of life. It was said that his heart contained the raw
        magic of creation, a power so vast that no being, mortal or divine, had ever dared to challenge him. Yet,
        Atheon’s lust for power and vengeance knew no bounds. If he could kill the Dragon God, he would not only be the
        end of the divine but also gain control over the very forces that governed the universe.

        Atheon’s journey to find Valtherion was perilous. Deep within the forgotten caverns of the Shattered Peaks,
        where the sky bled red and the ground rumbled with ancient energies, he found the gate that led to Valtherion’s
        realm. The air itself shimmered with magic, thick and suffocating. As he stepped through the gate, Atheon was
        swallowed by a maelstrom of creation, where stars were born and died in the blink of an eye, where time had no
        meaning, and where the Dragon God resided in the heart of it all—an enormous being with scales like molten
        silver and eyes that blazed with the fury of suns.</p>

    <div id="bottom">
        <h1>This is interval</h1>
    </div>


    <p> The battle between Atheon and Valtherion was nothing short of cataclysmic. Atheon’s sword met the Dragon God's
        claws in a flurry of fire and steel. With each swing of his blade, Atheon tore through the very fabric of
        existence, but Valtherion was no ordinary god. With each breath, the Dragon God mended the wounds in reality,
        his magic endlessly replenishing the world. Time rippled as they fought, the past and future colliding, entire
        lifetimes passing in mere moments. But even in the face of Valtherion’s immense power, Atheon refused to relent,
        his eyes burning with the desire to end this god as he had all the others.

        Yet, as the fight raged on, Atheon began to realize that Valtherion was not like the other gods he had slain.
        There was no arrogance, no cruelty in the Dragon God’s actions, only an overwhelming sense of duty. Valtherion
        did not fight out of malice, but out of necessity—to protect the delicate balance of the universe he had
        created. And for the first time, doubt crept into Atheon’s heart. He had always believed that the gods were
        tyrants who needed to be eradicated, but here was a god who had no desire for control, only harmony. It was then
        that Atheon hesitated, his blade trembling in his hand.

        In that moment of hesitation, Valtherion spoke, his voice echoing through the cosmos like the rolling of
        thunder. "You seek to end the divine, but you do not understand the consequences of your actions. The death of a
        god is not the death of a tyrant; it is the unraveling of the very threads that bind reality. If I fall, all
        that you know will fall with me." Atheon, exhausted and bloodied, stood before the Dragon God, realizing the
        weight of his quest. Killing gods had not freed the world; it had only brought it closer to chaos. He had become
        what he hated—an instrument of destruction.

        With a final, anguished cry, Atheon dropped his sword. The skies around them calmed, the swirling energies of
        creation settling once more. Valtherion, recognizing the change in the Godslayer’s heart, spared his life,
        though the cost of his actions would forever scar the world. Atheon vanished into the shadows, a broken man,
        while Valtherion returned to his eternal duty, ensuring that the balance of the universe remained intact. And
        so, the legend of the Godslayer and the Dragon God became a tale whispered by fireside, a reminder that even the
        most powerful must sometimes face the consequences of their own hubris.</p>
