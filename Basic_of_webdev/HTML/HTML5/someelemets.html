            <h4>The aside element</h4>
            <p>My definition of the aside element would be "information either unrelated or loosely related to the main content of a page should go in aside tags" – however, that is not W3C's definition. They write: "The aside element represents content that is tangentially related to the content that forms the main textual flow of a document."</p>
          </aside> <!--Puts content to the side-->

          <p>
            BDI stands for Bi-Directional Isolation.
            
            The <bdi> tag isolates a part of text that might be formatted in a different direction from other text outside it.
            
            This element is useful when embedding user-generated content with an unknown text direction.
