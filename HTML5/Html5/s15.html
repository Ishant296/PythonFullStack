<p>I have a date on 
    <time datetime="2008-02-14 20:00">Valentines day</time>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The time element does not render as anything special in any of the major browsers.</p>
<p>Definition and Usage

The time tag defines a human-readable date/time.

This element can also be used to encode dates and times in a machine-readable way so that user agents can offer to add birthday reminders or scheduled events to the user's calendar, and search engines can produce smarter search results.<p>
